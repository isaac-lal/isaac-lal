# Welcome To My GitHub 

Hi! My name is Isaac Lal and I am striving to become a Software Engineer in the future. 

Currently, Iâ€™m a lower sophomore at Hunter College and studying Computer Science as my major. On top of being determined to excel in all my classes, I am also working at IT/Coding internships to obtain additional work experience and further progress my skillset.

I'm also working on my own personal projects such as developing my own website, coding my own game, and understanding the fundamental concepts of coding and development. 

As I continue in my career, the prospect of becoming a developer in Software Engineering is in sight, and I am determined to endure and overcome these challenges in order to make that prospect come true!
