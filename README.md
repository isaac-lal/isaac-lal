<h3 align="left">📝 Learning</h3>
<p>
Currently, I am learning about React and Tailwind CSS. Since I had finished understanding the fundamentals of HTML, regular CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, learning about React and Tailwind CSS is the next step in my journey for Web Development. I am using these technologies in a completely redesigned website that I am building to test my skills. After I finish understanding React and Tailwind CSS, I will move onto learning about Next.js as the next step and continue to find more evolving technologies to learn about to make the front-end process easier.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Isaac's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I was always fascinated with websites ever since I was a kid watching videos on youtube.com, searching things up on google.com, playing games on multiple websites, and more. I loved how technology made the ideas of websites come to life, but I never really understood how it was made. I knew I wanted to be a part of the process for years, but I really haven't gotten my head engaged in it until August 2022.

With the goal of creating my own professional website, I had decided to learn about HTML and CSS to start. These two technologies helped me to create a very basic website with limited functionality, but still looked decent. After that, I have devoted most of my time in mastering JavaScript and concepts like if-statements, for-loops, logic, and transitioning into learning about Data Structures & Algorithms, along with the Document Object Model (DOM). After JavaScript was done, I am now using my time to learn everything about React and styling with Tailwind CSS.

In my experience being a front-end developer, I have loved all the technologies that I am using and how it's evolving my creativity and making me more efficient overall and unlocking my designing potential. I am now mastering my craft in front-end development by learning Next.js and other tools that will speed up the production of design. I definitely am loving the process of Web Development and it really helps me to appreciate the product that I create in the end.
