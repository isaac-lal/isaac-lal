# Welcome To My GitHub 

Hi! My name is Isaac Lal, and I am striving to become a Developer in the future.

I’m a lower sophomore at Hunter College and studying Computer Science as my major. On top of being determined to excel in all my classes, I am gaining outside coding experience through internships, programs, and courses to progress my skillset further. In addition, I’m working on projects such as developing my own personal website portfolio.

As I continue in my career, I am determined to constantly learn every day and overcome obstacles to make my prospect of becoming a developer come true!

Proficiency knowledge of programming languages respectfully: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C/C++, C#, and Java.
