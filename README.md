**`Coder`**

I'm learning how to code out of pure curiosity and for fun! I love to build cool projects with various useful technologies, frameworks, and libraries. It is very intriguing to me when I am putting all the pieces together, figuring out what needs to be utilized to build a certain application or feature. I love to code for fun, and have no plans to monetize my coding. However, I am very eager to build a simple application or project for my friends, as it will not only improve my skills but make me feel better about contributing to a major achievement! Eager to expand my knowledge, I am consistently learning whenever I have free-time as I do find coding/programming/development to be very intriguing.
