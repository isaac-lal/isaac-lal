**`Recreational Coder`**

Hello, World! I'm learning how to code for recreational purposes and teaching myself how to build projects with relevant programming languages and libraries. I'm having a lot of fun building projects that are useful and cool while learning a lot along the way. It is very intriguing to me when I am putting all the pieces together, figuring out what needs to be utilized to build a certain application or feature. Currently, my main method of learning is with YouTube, whether it be for learning the programming language or building a project from scratch. With this knowledge, I am able to think about the certain components and steps needed to build my own projects from scratch. Although there is still a lot more to learn, I am eager to expand my knowledge and I am consistently learning whenever I have free-time as I do find software to be very intriguing!
