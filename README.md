<h1> Welcome To My GitHub </h1>

<p style = "font-size: 15px">
Hi! My name is Isaac Lal and I am striving to become a Software Engineer in the future. 

Currently, I’m a lower sophomore at Hunter College and studying Computer Science as my major. On top of being determined to excel in all my classes, I am also working at IT/Coding internships to obtain additional work experience and further progress my skillset.

I'm also working on my own personal projects such as developing my own website, coding my own game, and understanding the fundamental concepts of coding and development. 

As I continue in my career, the prospect of becoming a developer in Software Engineering is in sight, and I am determined to endure and overcome these challenges in order to make that prospect come true!

<h3> Google: Code Next from April 2022 to June 2022 </h3>

<p style = "font-size:11px"> 
Code Next is a free, computer science education program that meets Black, Latinx and Native high school students in their own communities, and provides the skills and inspiration they need for long and rewarding careers in computer science-related fields. Between 2011 and 2018, Black, Hispanic and Native American college students each only made up 3.5 percent of computer science graduates — Code Next plans to change that.

As a minority student in my junior year of High School, this program was very appealing to me and was my first introduction to work-related Computer Science development aside from classes. I applied to Code Next Connect for the Spring Club which was 9 weeks long and lasted from April 2020 to June 2020. I was able to learn basic Python programming, since it is a very versatile and beginner friendly language. In addition, I was able to understand how programmers think when developing code, so I can apply that mindset to my own projects and experiences. Essentially, coding is only the entry-level requirements to becoming a programmer. Programming is using what you know from coding languages to solve advanced problems and build a foundation to push forward. Having this mindset made me learn more efficiently and helped me to understand what exactly a programmer/developer does in the workforce.

<h3> CodePath: Intro to Software Engineering from May 2022 to August 2022 </h3>
<p style="font-size:11px"> This 12-week virtual course taught by professional engineers is a foundation-level course for anyone considering taking computer science in college. The course will bridge the gap for those who want to feel more prepared to dive into further technical training. No prior experience in programming is required. You will work primarily in the Python programming language, learning basic concepts and how to break down complex problems to communicate your process. This supplemental course will give you a taste of what it is like to work in software engineering and give you access to industry professionals. If you are a college student with an interest in computer science, this is a great course to give you hands-on experience in computer science with a cohort of your peers. Learn valuable core concepts in computer science while getting an introduction to the crucial technical interview process.

Applied to the "Intro to Software Engineering" program offered on CodePath and learned fundamental programming concepts, working on Python, developing and solving complex problems, and obtaining the mindset of a programmer. An experience similar to this program was Google Code Next in 2020. With that being a high-school-level program and CodePath being a college-level one, CodePath helped me to understand more in-depth the fundamentals of being a programmer. Furthermore, it gave me an advanced understanding of what brand companies such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, etc., expect them to do. In addition, it was very beneficial to deepen my understanding of the Python programming language due to its versatility and effectiveness. </p>
